%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Requirements %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
A matlab installation (http://www.mathworks.de/products/matlab/) 
that supports object oriented programming is required. 
We tested the sources with MATLAB 7.13.0.564 (R2011b).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%% START %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Start matlab and change directory into the NNSAE folder or add the 
folder to your matlab path using addpath('where/the/NNSAE/folder/is').
Then execute the barsExampleNNSAE.m script. Have fun!
